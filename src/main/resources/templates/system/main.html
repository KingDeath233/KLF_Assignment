			      	<h5>Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services).[1][2][need quotation to verify][3][4] <br>Simply put, it is "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit. It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors."[5]
					<br>Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business.<br> If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.
					<br>The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company. A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.</h5>
